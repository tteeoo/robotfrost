# Robot Frost

Generating poetry with recurrent neural networks.

## Usage

First, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Generating poems

Note that before you generate anything, you'll need a trained model.

If you try to generate a poem without a `./state.dict.pth` file, a new one will be made with random values, but this is not ideal.

You can download a trained model from the releases page, or see the next section for training your own.

Run the following command:

```sh
python3 robotfrost.py --generate True
```

You should see an A.I. generated poem!

You can set a poem length with `--poem-length <int>`, and some starting words to use with `--starting-words <str>`.

#### Training the model

Run the following command to start training:

```sh
python3 robotfrost.py --cuda True
```

If you don't have a compatible GPU with CUDA cores, remove `--cuda True`.

Press ^C (control c) to stop. You should see the new file `./state.dict.pth` which contains the trained model.

See some options you can play with:

```sh
python3 robotfrost.py --help
```

## Some poems by Robot Frost

```
Lifelike path
Waiting
Steps is there? roads diverged in a figure in the shelves of all her at such a time?
It rests with the form
Of being anything
```

```
A flower bride, raspberries grow
Horse went outer must end kind, off light
Good-night, of following is books
But doubt are always
No matter for lantern-light long, yes, was,
May this a thing so very more best off a good one,
How they no one
To see the way he asked a thing like
Paul or be the thing so
```

```
Behind, manâ€™s
Moor
Until I looked at the ceiling,
The fire dark all is he's all the town to the ground,
Of their name
He won't ask him in the wind
I was not to say, for ask life who we set our two so much
As one but left to our taking
Too though he said,
And turn the name out of reach? him on me
He made the money
The least he was
```
